          '''The digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. From your mouth to your anus, the GI tract is composed of hollow organs connected to each other. In order from mouth to small intestine to large intestine, the organs that form your GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.

Digestion is important to breakdown food into nutrients that the body needs to produce energy, grow, and repair cells. In digestion, food is moved through the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The digestion process begins in the mouth with chewing and ends in the small intestine. Food molecules break down into smaller molecules as they pass through the GI tract when they mix with digestive juices.

Solid stool is produced as a result of digestion waste products passing through the large intestine. Food is broken down into nutrients by enzymes in digestive juices. During digestion, most food molecules are absorbed into the small intestine, along with water and minerals, and then are transported into other organs for storage or further chemical transformation. Most importantly, Regulators of hormones and nerves control digestion.

The diagram shows the main parts of the digestive system including the areas most likely to be affected by diseases such as Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis.''',
      para2: 
        '''As part of your digestive system, the small intestine plays an important role. Small intestines run from the stomach to the beginning of the large intestine, and they are hollow tubes approximately 20 feet long. Most nutrients from food are absorbed by the small intestine, which breaks down food from the stomach. The small intestine has three parts: Duodenum, Jejunum and Ileum.

Duodenum
Located at the beginning of the small intestine is the duodenum. First phase digestion is completed by the duodenum. The stomach's food is combined with pancreatic enzymes and gallbladder bile. Food is broken down with the help of enzymes and bile.

Jejunum
When food is digested in the duodenum, it moves into the jejunum, where its nutrients are absorbed. In the jejunum, the inner walls are folded in many circular patterns, which increase the surface area so that all the nutrients needed by the body is absorbed.

Ileum
In addition to absorbing bile acids, it also supplies the body with vitamin B12.

Following processing in the small intestine, food enters the large intestine (also known as the large bowel or colon). Most of the water in food is absorbed by the large intestine, which is about five feet long; the rest passes through the colon and out of the body as feces.''',
      para3: 
      '''The large intestine is primarily responsible for absorbing water. This is the natural habitat of a large and diverse population of bacteria (the stomach and small intestine contain few species of bacteria, most likely as a result of acids, bile and pancreatic secretions that kill most microbes). Pathogen invasions are highly prevented in the natural habitat. Vitamin K is synthesized as well as calcium, magnesium, and iron are absorbed through this enzyme. Additionally, it helps maintain electrolyte balance by absorbing potassium and sodium.''',

    '''The immune system's primary function is to protect the body from infection. Immune system is not limited to one area or region of the body like urinary system, cardiac system, or reproductive system. 

The immune system is divided into two major parts and mechanisms: innate immune system and acquired immune system. A natural or normally occurring process is described as innate, while an acquired process is defined as something that occurs for reasons other than those that are naturally occurring. A nonspecific response is part of the innate immune system, and a specific response is part of the acquired immune system. 

In the case of the skin, it acts as a nonspecific response of the innate immune system since it is the first line of defense against infections as we discussed in the section on the integumentary system before. In contrast, acquired immune responses are the result of an immune response to an antigen. The activation of T helper cells is an example of an acquired immune system.

It takes several factors to cause infection. It is often called the Chain of Infection. The diagram below shows the six links in the chain of infection''',
    para2: 
    '''Your body is protected against infection by white blood cells. The white blood cells in your body locate the site of infection as they travel through the bloodstream and tissues and act as an army general, alerting other white blood cells to the infection to help defend your body from an unknown infection. By producing antibody proteins, your white blood cells attach to the invader and destroy it once they arrive.
    
There are five types of white blood cells: 

- Neutrophils: kill bacteria, fungi, and foreign debris in the body, protecting it from infections.

- Lymphocytes: These cells produce protein to fight infection and protect against viral infections (antibodies).

- Eosinophil: defends your body from parasites, cancer cells, and assists the basophil in responding to allergies.

- Basophils: cause allergic reactions such as coughing, sneezing, and runny noses.

- Monocytes: Defend against infection by cleaning up damaged cells.''',
    para3: 
    '''The lymphatic system is a system of thin tubes and lymph nodes that run throughout the body. These tubes are called lymph vessels or lymphatic vessels. The lymph system is an important part of our immune system. It plays a role in:

- Fighting bacteria and other infections.
- Destroying old or abnormal cells, such as cancer cells. 

As with the blood circulation, the lymphatic system works similarly. Like arteries and veins that carry blood, lymph vessels branch throughout the body. A colorless liquid called lymph is transported by the lymphatic system tubes, which are much finer.

A type of white blood cell called lymphocytes is found in high concentrations in the lymph. They fight infections and destroy abnormal or damaged cells. In the process of blood circulation around the body, fluid escapes from blood vessels and enters the body tissues. A tissue fluid is formed as a result of this fluid transporting food to the cells and bathing the body tissues.

As a result, waste products, bacteria, and damaged cells are collected in the fluid. If cancer cells are present, it also collects them. It is then drained into lymph vessels. Following that, lymph flows into the lymph vessels, where they are filtered by the lymph glands, which identify bacteria and damaged cells and remove them.

After moving through the lymph glands, the lymph joins up with larger vessels known as lymphatic vessels. As they travel along the thoracic duct, they eventually reach a very large lymph vessel in the neck. Afterwards, the lymph is emptied back into the blood circulation through the thoracic duct.''',

    para2: 
    '''Your kidneys are made up of millions of filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. Nephrons filter and remove waste from your blood through two steps: the glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns necessary substances.

A cluster of blood vessels called the glomerulus receives blood as it flows into each nephron. Water and smaller molecules can be passed through the tubules because the walls of the glomerulus are thin. The blood vessel remains filled with larger molecules, such as proteins and blood cells.

Your body absorbs almost all of the water, minerals, and nutrients it needs as the filtered fluid moves through the tubules. Excess acid is removed from the blood by the tubule. Urine is formed from the remaining fluid and wastes in the tubule.

The renal artery transports blood to the kidney. Eventually, the blood reaches the nephrons by branching off this large blood vessel. During kidney function, the blood is filtered by the tiny blood vessels of the glomeruli and flows out of the renal vein. ''',
    para3: 
    '''Located just above and behind the pubic bone, the urinary bladder is a muscular sac. Upon emptying, the bladder appears like a pear shaped object. The kidneys produce urine, which travels down two tubes known as ureters to the bladder. During urine retention, layers of muscle tissue stretch along the bladder's walls.

In general, the bladder has a capacity of 400-600 mL. When you urinate, there is a contraction of the bladder muscles, which opens two sphincters (valves) to let the urine out. A urethra is responsible for carrying urine out of the body after urine exits the bladder.

A man's urethra is 8 inches longer than a woman's (1.5 inches) since it passes through the penis.''',

Oxygen and nutrients are supplied to your body's organs through the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood vessels). In addition to transporting waste away for disposal, your blood vessels also transport carbon dioxide. The cardiovascular system is also responsible for:

- Make sure your body gets what it needs during exercise as well as rest.
- Maintain a normal body temperature.''',

    '''The Heart is a hollow, muscular, four-chambered organ about the size of a fist. Three layers make up the heart: an inner lining known as endocardium; a muscle layer known as myocardium; and an outer layer known as epicardium. The pericardium is a fibrous sac covering the heart.

As the heart contracts, pericardial fluid prevents friction between surfaces by lubricating the space between pericardial layers (pericardial space).''',
    para3: 
    '''Using electrodes, electrocardiograms (ECGs) can detect the heart's electrical activity on the body surface. Each waveform is identified with a letter P, QRS, T, and U. A depolarization of the atria is represented by the first wave of P, which is triggered by the SA node. 

It represents the depolarization of the ventricles from the AV node. The time between the beginning of P wave and the beginning of QRS wave is explained by a delay in impulse transmission through the AV node. Ventricles repolarize as a result of the T wave.

Depending on the cause, the U wave may be related to hypokalemia or repolarization of the Purkinje fibers. Heart impulses travel from one area of the heart to another through intervals between these waves (PR, QRS, and QT). Measurement of these intervals can reveal pathologic conditions when they differ from the time references.''',

In the nervous system, nerve cells, or neurons, form the basic building blocks. There are different shapes for neurons according to their location and function in the body. There is a long fibre called an axon on each neuron that looks like a finger. Dendrites are finger-like projections on each neuron.

A special membrane called a myelin sheath coats the axon. Several bumps are present on the axon, which is feathered out. Neurons are connected by dendrites from each other. Synapses are spaces between bumps and dendrites.

Chemicals called neurotransmitters carry messages across the synapse between neurons. A neuron can't be replaced if it dies or is injured or infected, unlike many other cells in the body.''',
    
    para2: ''' An individual's central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bathes them and is wrapped in a thin lining called meninges.

The Brain

Even though it makes up only two percent of the body's weight, the brain is the heart of the body. Millions of neural connections cross this soft, jelly-like organ. Our consciousness and personalities are given by our brains, which oversee the workings of our bodies.

The Spinal Cord

The spinal cord runs the length of the body and connects the brain to the rest of the body. Vertebrae protect the spinal cord. Arms, legs, and torso are connected to the spinal cord by nerves.

The Peripheral Nervous System

Peripheral nervous tissue is what lies outside the central nervous system, and is connected to the brain and spinal cord by nerves. Somatic and autonomic nervous systems make up the system.''',
    para3: '''The Autonomic Nervous System
    
In the peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system plays an important role. The main role of the nervous system is to regulate the glands and organs without our conscious involvement. The autonomic nervous system is made up of two parts: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.

The two systems have opposite effects on the body. As we move through our environment, these body systems coordinate a multitude of adjustments our changing needs demand. 

As an example, when we get too hot or eat food (or even think of eating food), our salivary glands produce saliva to allow us to see clearly. Our pupils are automatically adjusted to allow correct amounts of light into our eyes.

The Somatic Nervous System

As part of the peripheral nervous system, the somatic nervous system is also involved. The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) receives information from the eyes, ears, skin, and muscles. Our muscles are able to contract and relax as it obeys commands from the central nervous system.''',
